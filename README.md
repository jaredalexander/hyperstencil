Hi Marc,

How's it going? I'm a Lead Software Engineer (focused on mobile development) at Capital One and we are looking for more iOS and Android experts. I found you on LinkedIn and I'm interested in chatting - would you have 10-15 minutes? Saw you used to work at Urban Airship - I used to use that back in the day!

If you want to know more about me, you can check me out at:
